## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

My maine focus here is to create a responsive one page website, the challenge was to structure the project in a way that would feel natural and easy to change in the future. The hardest part was the mobile menu, which I had to experiment with a few things to get right.

### Useful resources

- [SASS Docs](https://www.sass-lang.com/documentation) - This helped me with sass mixins and functions.
- [MDN Docs](https://www.mdn.net) - This was a great resource for miscellanious things like specific css props and JS functions.
